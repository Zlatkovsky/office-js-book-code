# Key Concepts for Using the New Office.js APIs

Code samples for the forthcoming "Key Concepts for Using the New Office.js APIs" book.  For more information, see [http://michaelzlat.com/officejs](http://michaelzlat.com/officejs).

The samples can be pasted into the [API Tutorial Add-in](https://store.office.com/app.aspx?assetid=WA104379613), available free from the [Office Store](https://store.office.com/app.aspx?assetid=WA104379613).

Each sample comes with a "setup" script (that will populate the needed data, etc.), and the actual script shown in the book.
